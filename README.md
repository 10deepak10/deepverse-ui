ðŸŒŒ Deepverse UI
Deepverse UI is a modern, headless UI component library built with Angular. Itâ€™s designed to be fully customizable, scalable, and component-driven. The goal is to provide a flexible foundation where developers have full control over styling while reusing clean, logic-driven components.

ðŸ”§ Why Deepverse UI?
ðŸ’¡ Headless-first approach â€“ Logic and behavior handled internally; you control the UI.

ðŸ§± Scalable architecture â€“ Reusable, maintainable, and structured for real-world apps.

ðŸŽ¨ Theme-agnostic â€“ No forced styles. Plug in your own design system.

â™¿ Accessible â€“ Keyboard navigation and screen reader support.

ðŸ”— Angular focused, with a plan to expose components via Web Components in the future.
