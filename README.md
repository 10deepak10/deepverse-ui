# 🌌 Deepverse UI

**Deepverse UI** is a modern, headless UI component library built with Angular. It’s designed to be fully customizable, scalable, and component-driven. The goal is to provide a flexible foundation where developers have full control over styling while reusing clean, logic-driven components.

## 🔧 Why Deepverse UI?

- 💡 **Headless-first approach** – Logic and behavior handled internally; you control the UI.
- 🧱 **Scalable architecture** – Reusable, maintainable, and structured for real-world apps.
- 🎨 **Theme-agnostic** – No forced styles. Plug in your own design system.
- ♿ **Accessible** – Keyboard navigation and screen reader support.
- 🔗 **Angular focused**, with plans to expose components via Web Components.

It’s built for developers who want control over styles without rewriting logic, enabling faster development with a clean and scalable architecture.
